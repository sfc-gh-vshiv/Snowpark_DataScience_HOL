Hi [Customer Name], 

As discussed during our last call, would you be interested in having your Data Science team participate in an end-to-end Hands On Lab? Typically start with some enablement around what Snowpark is and how it is differentiated. For example:

Snowpark is Snowflake's development framework that enables users to leverage their familiar language of choice (SQL, Python, Java, Scala) without sacrificing the differentiated benefits that customers love about Snowflake - our architecture, our security, our governance, and our ease of use:

- **Ease of Use:** Snowflake is a fully managed service, which eliminates any complexity and any time wasted on non-value added tasks / technical debt. 
- **Governed & Secure:** Snowflake ensures a unified, built-in governance and security model - eliminating the need for customers to spend time on different security tasks based on cloud provider, product edition, object type, compute cluster, etc.
- **Single Engine:** Snowflake provides a single engine that can scale up/out instantaneously (as opposed to minutes/hours) so customers do not need to keep their resources up and running or pay for idle time, nor do they need to make complex configuration choices that oftentimes lead to inefficiencies in performance and cost. Users can leverage a single engine regardless of workload or skillset (SQL, Scala, Python, Java).
- **Collaboration:** Snowflake provides a global data ecosystem, with efficient and automatic data sharing capabilities - making it seamless to govern across environments and collaborate externally.

Customers using Snowpark are seeing:
- 2 to 10 x price efficiency gains
- 2 to 10 X performance improvements
- as much as 2x productivity gains for these Data Engineers as they no longer need to manage Spark

During the actual hands-on-lab portion, we will walk through:
- Preparing and transforming data in Snowpark
- Creating a simple ML-powered forecast
- Creating an ML model in Snowpark
- Registering and operationalizing the ML model using Snowpark
- Creating an interactive Streamlit app in Snowflake, leveraging the Snowpark model

Please feel free to reach out with any questions, or if there are other/additional topics that you would like us to include in the session! 

Best,

[Snowflake Account Team]
